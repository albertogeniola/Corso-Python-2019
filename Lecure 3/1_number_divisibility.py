"""
Write a script that determines if one integer number is divisible by another.
The two input numbers are provided via the following two variables:
<a> and <b>.

If the input_number_a is divisible by input_number_b, the program must print "Number <a> is
divisible by <b> (quotient=<quotient>)". Otherwise, if that's not the case, the program should
output "Number <a> is not divisible by <b> (remainder=<remainder>)"

For instance, if a=10 and b=5, the program should print:
Number 10 is divisible by 5 (quotient=2)

Similarly, if a=11 and b=5, the expected output is:
Number 11 is not divisible by 5 (remainder=1)

So... would 99.603â€¬ be divisible by 17? Use the program you built to check it out!

input_number_a = 10
